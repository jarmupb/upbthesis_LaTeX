# LaTeX templates for writing theses at Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana

![Logo UPB](./img/logoUPB.png)

This repository contains LaTeX classes (.cls) for writing your thesis at UPB. The file you require is **upbthesis.cls**

There are two main versions:
- v1_legacy: that organizes the thesis by sections, as it is usually done in, e.g., articles. I consider this version legacy, because I don't have intentions to further improve it.
- v2: that organizes the thesis by chapters and, optionally, by parts. This one is more like the standard book template. I'll be working on this template more.
