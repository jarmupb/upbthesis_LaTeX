# LaTeX templates for writing theses at Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana

**upbthesis.cls** is a LaTeX class for writing your thesis at UPB. Knowing how to write in LaTeX is a prerequisite.

There are two main versions:
- v1_legacy: this .cls version organizes the thesis by sections, as it is usually done in, e.g., articles. I consider this version legacy, because I don't have intentions to further improve it.
- [v2](https://github.com/jarmupb/upbthesis_LaTeX/tree/master/v2): this .cls organizes the thesis by chapters and, optionally, by parts. This one is more like the standard book template. I'll be working on this template more.

You have the following possibilities:
- To download the .cls file directly [click here](https://github.com/jarmupb/upbthesis_LaTeX/blob/master/v2/upbthesis.cls).
