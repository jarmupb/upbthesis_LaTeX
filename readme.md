# LaTeX class for writing theses at Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana

**upbthesis.cls** is a LaTeX class for writing your thesis at UPB.  
*Knowing how to write using LaTeX is a prerequisite*.

You have the following possibilities:
- To download a .zip bundle with all the relevant files [click here](https://github.com/jarmupb/upbthesis_LaTeX/blob/master/v2/upbthesis.zip).
- To download the .cls file directly *use right click and download file as* <a href="https://github.com/jarmupb/upbthesis_LaTeX/blob/master/v2/upbthesis.cls" download>here</a>.
- To explore the repository that contains all the files [click here](https://github.com/jarmupb/upbthesis_LaTeX/tree/master/v2).
- To see the documentation [click here](https://github.com/jarmupb/upbthesis_LaTeX/blob/master/v2/upbthesis_manual.pdf).

For you to know, there are two versions so far:
- v1_legacy: this .cls version organizes the thesis by sections, as it is usually done in, e.g., articles. I consider this version legacy, because I don't have intentions to further improve it.
- [v2](https://github.com/jarmupb/upbthesis_LaTeX/tree/master/v2): this .cls organizes the thesis by chapters and, optionally, by parts. This one is more like the standard book template. I'll be working on this template more.
